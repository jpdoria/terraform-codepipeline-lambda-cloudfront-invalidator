# About

This needs to be built manually because Terraform doesn't support the building of Go projects.

The Terraform configs are not included in this repository.

# Build

```bash
make
```

# Deploy

After building the project, you can deploy it using the following command:

```bash
cd my-terraform-project/
terraform apply
```
